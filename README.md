### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alex.

 - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a React application for a Solar Company. The tech stack includes:
	 - PostgreSQL + GraphQL (via Hasura serverless) for data storage
	 - Node + Express.js for back-end servers
	 - React.js + Material UI / Styled Components for client
	 - ... and Apache Cordova for mobile deployment

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much as I possibly can about ES6+ Javascript, and React, but spending some time learning Clojure as well as database models like GraphQL.
